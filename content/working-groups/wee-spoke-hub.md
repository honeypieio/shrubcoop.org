**Please Note - Wee Spoke Hub is currently on hiatus!**

**We are an Edinburgh-based bike shop with a difference!**

We are currently part of the Scotland Cycle Repair Scheme!

This is providing free repairs and maintenance to people who need it most, to get thousands of people across the country on their bikes.

It’s funded by Transport Scotland and administered by [Cycling UK](https://www.facebook.com/CyclingUK/?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZU1l2lmZ_CT2ud6LoUTllOlI9pyAROKJ9wPfuxJ9OXZj76sF3ZaIQgl71ZeaQECy2me2VyOSUtrPGRb44bEwnQqtMHsu7RhMTfFiKHeMkatEn2Vis4pWvNSoIQgjAJvN7JoCFFIsAm2SdAbTb3l7Vam6vTcNi0nQ7TWX67WTXEnTWc8xxo2QhQrc6-oum9-Ff0&__tn__=kK-R) to provide free repairs up to the value of £50.

The coronavirus crisis has hit many people hard, so we know it can be difficult to pay for essential bike repairs.

If you’d struggle to afford bike maintenance right now, just contact us and get your repair booked in.

What else do we do?

* We sell second-hand and brand new bike parts.

At the Wee Spoke Hub, we aim to help make cycling an affordable, attractive and accessible mode of transport for everyday use. Because of this, we have introduced an Accessible Tiered Pricing System, to allow us to operate in line with our core values.

**Tiered System**

Tier 1 - @cost (75% of our published prices) for those unemployed or on less than Scottish Living Wage of £9.50 an hour.

Tier 2 - @ 90% of our published prices for those under Scottish Median Wage of £24897 per annum.

Tier 3 - @ 100% of industry standard with the option to donate more in support of our community and outreach programmes for those earning Scottish Median Wage of £24897 per annum or above.

Tier 4 - If you are in the top 1%, then we’ll charge you a flat £1k for your bike repair or refurbished bike! All profits will go to supporting our outreach work and helping those in need get up and running on 2 wheels!

### Frequently Asked Questions
