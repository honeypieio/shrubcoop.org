Each year, **one-third** of all food produced for human consumption worldwide goes to waste. This is approximately 1.3 billion tonnes. _(FAO, 2019)._ In central Edinburgh, **27.1 tonnes** of food goes to waste every week - that's the equivalent of roughly **54,000 meals** unnecessarily thrown in the bin _(Zero Waste Edinburgh, 2017)._

The Food Sharing Hub, located in our Zero Waste Hub at 22 Bread Street, is **Scotland’s first rescued food shop** and exists to save surplus food from supermarkets and small businesses around Edinburgh from an unnecessary fate in the bin.

It's open for everyone. Simply come along to the Food Sharing Hub. Fill a basket with food and **pay as you feel**.

**We're open 11am to 6pm Tuesday to Saturday**

### How it works

The Food Sharing Hub is working with a host of local supermarkets and small businesses via Fareshare and Neighbourly to rescue surplus food that might otherwise end up in landfill.  We get a lot of fresh produce - **fruits and vegetables**, as well as **bread and baked goods** that are still tasty and safe to eat past their 'best before'. We also get seasonal products that shops need to clear away, dented tins, cut flowers and all sorts of surprises.

We use cargo bikes wherever possible to collect food and to distribute it to partner organisations.  While we have two cargo bikes ourselves we also work with [Cargo Bike Movement](https://www.cargobikemovement.com/) and their fleet of bikes.

We want our community to know the process behind the food we get on our shelves. It takes a dedicated team of volunteers...

In the evenings, we have collectors who travel round all our partner stores on cargo bikes or by car, collecting food that the stores haven't managed to sell. While we have two cargo bikes ourselves we also work with [Cargo Bike Movement](https://www.cargobikemovement.com/) and their fleet of bikes.  
⬇️  
These collectors then bring the food to a team of volunteers waiting at the Zero Waste Hub who sort through it and weigh it. This team take some of the food to local hostels on their way home. This sorting happens between 8.30pm and 11pm!  
⬇️  
The next morning, a team of volunteers come in early to arrange the food on the shelves and put aside some food for other partner organisations.  
⬇️  
Our Café volunteers then select items that they can use in our vegan café that day such as fruit for our smoothies!  
⬇️  
Our doors open at 11am and our shelves are looking full and tidy - all thanks to all these people!

The Food Sharing Edinburgh project also coordinates a network of surplus food collections from small businesses and redistributes it to charities across the city who ensure that it reaches people facing food insecurity and offers them a dignified way of accessing nutritious food, while tackling unnecessary food waste.

The Food Sharing Edinburgh project is generously funded by donations from our community and grant funding from:

* Keep Scotland Beautiful's Community Climate Asset Fund
* Corra Foundation's Community Recovery Fund
* Foundation Scotland's Response, Recovery & Resilience Fund
* Scotmid's Community Grant scheme
