The **Zero Waste Hub** is your one stop shop for sustainable living!

In the Zero Waste Hub you can swap your preloved things in our [**Swapshop**](https://www.shrubcoop.org//working-groups/swapshop/), enjoy some rescued food from our [**Food Sharing Hub**](https://www.shrubcoop.org//working-groups/food-sharing-hub/), participate in our [**Events**](https://www.shrubcoop.org/events/) or just hang out and grab a tea or coffee from our **vegan café**.

Our café serves a range of cold drinks, teas and coffees with no extra charge for non-dairy milks! - Our food service is paused at the moment but we hope to restart is as soon as possible. 

#### Say No To Disposable Cups!

Why not slow down and enjoy a drink in our community space? If you need to take away your food and hot drinks, please bring your own reusable cups and containers.
