As a member you're welcome to take part in how our organisation is run! Every 4 weeks we meet with ordinaty members, volunteers, staff and representatives from all our working groups for updates on whats going on across the coop.

**Everybody is welcome and you don't need to be an expert** in any of the proposals up for discussion and you don't need to have attended a meeting before. Simply come along, listen to the ideas and let us know what you think of them to help us make the best choices we can.

_The meeting goes approximately as follows:_

_6pm to 7pm:_  
Discussions and proposals brought forward by members

_7pm to 7.10pm:_  
Break

_7.10pm to 8pm:_  
Updates from working groups and any other business (AOB)  
  
Any agenda items should be sent to [agenda@shrubcoop.org]() one week before the meeting date at the latest, so the agenda can be written. If you would like to bring in a discussion topic or a proposal, but don't know how, please contact us at [hello@shrubcoop.org](hello@shrubcoop.org) and we will provide you with templates and instructions.

This is a great opportunity to have a say in decisions that affect the whole coop, and also a place to learn what is going on across the community. It helps the community identify gaps and work towards our shared goal of community empowerment for a world without waste.
